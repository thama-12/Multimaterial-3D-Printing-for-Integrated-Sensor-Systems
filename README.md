# Multimaterial 3D Printing for Integrated Sensor Systems

## Overview

This project explores the development of flexible, high-performance strain sensors using multimaterial 3D printing. By integrating Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU) with conductive fillers such as Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs), Carbon Black, and Graphene, the project addresses limitations in conventional strain sensors related to rigidity, high cost, and environmental instability.

## Objective

To fabricate and evaluate strain sensors with enhanced gauge factor, linearity, hysteresis, and response time through the use of:
- Advanced material combinations
- Optimized 3D printing techniques (FDM-based)
- Controlled geometrical design and sensor fabrication

## Key Features

- **Materials Used**: TPU, PBAT, CNTs, Carbon Black, Graphene  
- **Fabrication Method**: Dual-extrusion FDM 3D Printing  
- **Mixing Methods**: Melt blending and solution mixing  
- **Sensor Designs**: Serpentine and multi-layer geometries  
- **Testing Methods**: SEM, tensile/compression, thermal and electrical analysis  
- **Standard Followed**: ASTM D257-14, ASTM E1508-12

## Outcomes

- Achieved high flexibility (elongation ~400%)
- Demonstrated gauge factor ~2.0 with low hysteresis
- Enhanced electrical response through uniform filler dispersion
- Strong interlayer adhesion confirmed through SEM analysis

## Applications

- Wearable electronics
- Structural health monitoring
- Soft robotics
- Biomedical sensing
